# Digit Detection Neural Network

This VHDL-based project implements a digit detection neural network for recognizing digits (0-9) from images. The project utilizes the simple concept of matrix operations on pixels of images to recognize digits in images.

## Overview

The digit detection neural network is designed to process images and identify the digits present in them. The VHDL implementation leverages matrix operations to analyze pixel values and make predictions about the digit represented in the image.

## How it Works

1. **Image Input:**
   - The neural network takes images as input, where each image is represented as a matrix of pixel values in coe file.

2. **Matrix Operations:**
   - Matrix operations, such as convolution and pooling, are applied to extract features from the input images.

3. **Neural Network Layers:**
   - The processed features are then passed through multiple layers of the neural network, including fully connected layers with activation functions.

4. **Digit Recognition:**
   - The final layer of the neural network produces output corresponding to the recognized digit. The digit with the highest probability is considered the predicted digit.

## Implementation Details

- **VHDL:** The project is implemented in VHDL, a hardware description language, making it suitable for FPGA-based implementations.

## Usage

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Configure the VHDL code to match the specifications of your FPGA board.

2. **Compile and Load:**
   - Compile the VHDL code and load it onto the FPGA.

3. **Input Images:**
   - Provide input images to the FPGA for digit detection.
